This Excel-based data entry tool simplifies and streamlines manual data collection. The workbook features a user-friendly entry form in the first worksheet and a VBA-powered Submit button that automatically records inputs into a structured database table on the second worksheet. This eliminates the need for repetitive copy-pasting and minimizes errors, improving data accuracy and workflow efficiency. It’s a simple yet powerful tool designed to bring automation and structure to everyday data entry tasks—especially useful in environments where full-scale database systems are not readily available.

This project has two worksheet: Form and Database. I started by creating and styling the Employee Data Form which has 12 fields including a dropdown for Department, option button(radio button) for location, a calculated field(Net Pay) and a Submit button(which was added at the end). Then i copied the labels of the form to another cell within the worksheet, and linked the input fields in the form to their corresponding labels Then i created another worksheet(Database) to store the entires from the data entry form, I copied the labels from Form workheet and pasted the transpose into the database worksheet and styled the table.

Now to automate the inputs from the Form going under thier corresponding column headers in the database, I started recording Macro from the Form worksheet, and inserted sheet rows into the table in Database worksheet then stoped recording the macro. I then created a submit button and assigned the program(macro) to it, now with the click of the button the inputs from the form are sent and stored in the database worksheet. Lastly, I saved the workbook as macro-enabled workbook and added a layer of protection to the data entry form so changes cannot be made on the form except entering data. Now Excel will give a warning message to any change attempts in the worksheet.
